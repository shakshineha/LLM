### NLP-to-SQL Query Generation using LLMs
## üöÄ Project Overview

This project leverages GPT-4 Turbo, LangChain, and Regex-based parsing to convert natural language queries into SQL queries dynamically. It extracts relevant tables and attributes from a given database schema, making SQL query generation more efficient and automated.

## üî• Features

- NLP-to-SQL conversion using GPT-4 Turbo & LangChain
- Database schema extraction to identify tables, attributes, and relationships
- Regex-based SQL query formatting for clean and structured output
- Dynamic query generation for multi-table SQL joins (upcoming)

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) & Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integration (planned)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo (LLM for NLP-to-SQL conversion)
- LangChain (for prompt engineering & query processing)
- Regex (for extracting and formatting SQL queries)
- SQLAlchemy / MySQL (for testing and execution)
- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) & RAG (Future Enhancements)

## ‚ö° Installation & Setup

Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SQL-Generation
_cd SQL-Generation_

**Install dependencies:** _pip install -r requirements.txt_

**Set up your OpenAI API Key:**

from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-4-turbo", openai_api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

## üöÄ Usage

_Run the script and input your natural language query:_

nlp_query = "Get all donor names and emails"
sql_query = nlp_to_sql(nlp_query)
print("Generated SQL Query:", sql_query)

The output will be a properly formatted SQL query:

SELECT Name, Email FROM ActiveDonors;

## üìå Future Enhancements
- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to optimize table relationships and joins.
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve query context understanding.
- Support for complex SQL queries with multiple table joins.
